Urban System Theory
===================

Urban scaling law
-----------------

About British cities – prior to the industrial revolution, Britain had one big city – London and a plausible hypothesis but we can’t test it because of lack of data, is that then british cities followed a rank size rule. But the cities of the industrial revolution were not formed from a central place theory (which is consistent with Zipf); they were built on the coalfield which is where all the northern cities are. The midlands was built also on coal and iron while Liverpool (as well as Bristol) where the ports. Basically our problems with validating Zipf, scaling size and so on in Britain (England) have something to do with historial development – history matters – or as we say in complexity theory, the evolution of the city system is path dependent

Fabulous question Zhengzi! This is another limitation of this type of analysis, it does not take into account the interaction between cities. But of course it matters, since this is linked to growth and spillovers, so the task is to find the impact, and this is still a research question!

There are really three types if scaling at least 1) inverse power laws that relate to size distributions like cities – Zipf –  2) scaling power laws that relate one variable to another – say income as a function of population – allometry – but there is a third – that we haven’t talked about today that is really important and central to spatial interaction – gravity transport models – the inverse square law that relates to what you are saying I think and we will look at this in urban simulation

Nominal data 名义变量
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* Differentiates items based only on names； No order；Also called categorical data
* Example:

  * names, gender, country names
  * 土地利用分类数据

* Descriptive methods

  * Equality: 'apple' is not 'pear', 'apple' is 'apple'
  * Mode (the most common item)

Ordinal data 有序变量
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* Allow for rank order, but not the relative degree of difference
* Example

  * measurement of opinions
  * 高中低程度

* Descriptive methods

  * Equality Mode
  * The median: middle-ranked item
  * Differences do not make sense, nor do means.

Interval data 间隔变量
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* Allow for the degree of difference between items, but not the ratio between them. The zero value is arbitrary.
* Example

  * temperature with the Celsius scale
  * 日期

* Descriptive methods

  * Equality, mode, median
  * Addition, Arithmetic mean
  * Ratio? The coordinate of 8 is twice as far as that of 4

    * 不能说20度是10度的两倍热

Boxplot
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   ## This program creates a boxplot from data stored in a csv file and saves it as a png image.

   ## The data file must be one column of numbers - no column labels, etc.
   ## It must be saved as a csv file (e.g. use "Save As" in Excel and choose csv format).
   ## It must be saved in the same folder as this program.
   ## See the file sample_boxplot_data.csv for reference.

   ## In the next line, replace sample_boxplot_data.csv with the filename of your data:
   data_filename = 'sample_boxplot_data.csv'

   ## In the next line, replace boxplot with the filename you wish to save as:
   output_filename = 'boxplot.png'

   ## Use the next line to set figure height and width (experiment to check the scale):
   figure_width, figure_height = 4,10

   ## You can ignore these two lines:
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np

   data = np.genfromtxt(data_filename)

   ## If there are errors importing the data, you can also copy the data in as a list.
   ## e.g. data = [1.95878982, 2.59203983, 1.22704688, ...]

   ## This line creates the figure. 
   plt.figure(figsize=(figure_width,figure_height))

   ## Uncomment the next three lines to set the axis limits (otherwise they will be set automatically):
   ##axis_min = 0.95
   ##axis_max = 4.05
   ##plt.ylim([axis_min,axis_max])

   ## The next lines create and save the plot:
   plt.xlim([0.75,1.25])
   plt.xticks([])
   plt.boxplot(data, manage_ticks=(False))
   plt.savefig(output_filename)

Exponential distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* The Exponential distribution is linked to the Poisson distribution.
* If the Poisson measures the probability of x events within a time period, then the Exponential measures how long we are likely to wait between events.
* So imagine an emergency room in a hospital. The exponential distribution will tell us how likely we are to wait x amount of time from one patient arriving to the next.

Power Laws


* A TED talk on power laws for cities, given by one of the authors of the paper that I referred to in the lecture. Entertaining, relevant and informative and only 17 minutes long: https://www.ted.com/talks/geoffrey_west_the_surprising_math_of_cities_and_corporations\##t-173864
* Here is a nice tutorial on power laws and log-log plots from the University of Plymouth. It goes into a little more detail than we did, so it is good for people who had trouble following (skip the bits that don't relate to what was covered in the lecture) or who are confident and want to extend/test their knowledge.http://www.reading.ac.uk/AcaDepts/sp/PPLATO/imp/interactive%20mathematics/loglog2.pdf
* Here is an academic paper on power laws in cities. It is well worth a read for background knowledge, but do not worry if you do not understand all of it (skip the mathematical section: "Urban Growth Equation" on p7304, unless you are a mathematician or a masochist). http://www.pnas.org/content/104/17/7301.full.pdf
* There is also an accessible summary of the paper here:http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2007/10/18/power-laws-and-cities/
* But note that there is a mistake in that summary. When they talk about "exponential" increases, they mean "superlinear". The academic paper does not discuss any exponential relationships.

Measuring Relationships
-----------------------

Objectives
^^^^^^^^^^


#. Understand the concept of covariance, correlation and what it says about data relationships. 
#. Be able to measure a data relationship using simple linear regression. 
#. Learn how regression can be extended for data with more than two dimensions. 
#. Understand how to identify whether additional data provides additional information.

Lectures
~~~~~~~~

How many ways do we have to measure correlation? What are the main differences between these measurements? What is partial correlation and how can we understand it intuitively?
We can't use correlation to predict, as correlation does not imply causation, but if variables are dependent then they are either causal to each other (in either direction) or driven by a common driver.
Do we need to perform a heteroskedasticity test before regression, and how can we do this?


* data type
* distribution
* relationship
* regression

Motivations for data transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#. To formulate a different question
#. To meet the assumptions of a statistical inference procedure
#. To make data easier to visualise

Outliers and Dealing with it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* 先用方法识别outliers ，根据经验判断是否保留
* types of outliers

  #. Error
  #. Points not following the pattern

     * If you are studying the overall pattern, they need to be removed -- e.g. City of London (in London) -- e.g. Vantican City (1000 pop, gender ratio 7:1)
     * "Statistical oddities"

  #. Points that are essential to the overall pattern

     * Don't remove them e.g. New York in UＳ pop data

* There are many approaches to identify outliers (e.g. Tukey fences), but determining an outlier is a subjective exercise.
* Dealing with outliers (not sure type 2 or 3)

  * Retention, **but the application should use methods that are robust to outlier points**
  * Exclusion. If some outliers are excluded, the reasons should be clearly stated on the report.

Correlation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Person Correlation
""""""""""""""""""

$$
cor(X,Y) = r(X,Y) = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{std(X)\times std(Y)}
$$

**limitations**


* The Pearson correlation coefficient measures only **linear association**\ : how nearly the data fall on a straight line.
* It is not a good summary of association if the scatterplot has a nonlinear (curved) pattern.
* When you present the correlation, remember to present a scatterplot.
* The Pearson correlation coefficient is appropriate only for interval or ratio variables, not nominal or ordinal variables -- even if their values are numerical.
* Note the difference between the data type of the variable and the value.

Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

$$
r\ *{s}=\rho*\ {\mathrm{rg}\ *{X}, \mathrm{rg}*\ {Y}}=\frac{\operatorname{cov}\left(\mathrm{rg}\ *{X}, \mathrm{rg}*\ {Y}\right)}{\sigma\ *{\mathrm{rg}*\ {X}} \sigma\ *{\mathrm{rg}*\ {Y}}}
$$


* It is applicable for interval/ratio data

  * Transform the value into ranks;
  * Calculate the Rank correlation.

* But it is different from Pearson's correlation, and they are
  incomparable.
* 
  Less sensitive to outliers than Pearson correlation

Limitations
"""""""""""


* Pearson correlation is not applicable for nominal/ordinal data.
* It measures only linear association, and is not a good summary for non-linear data.
* It is a measure of association, not causation. It is not robust to outliers, less robust than Spearman's rank correlation.

correlation is a global metric, it doesn't give the local relation.

* Normally distributed errors : for each value of x, the errors have a normal distribution about the regression line.
* Equal error variance for all x values :  the error value does not change because of the x values

NOT a Necessary Condition! : Normally Distributed Data

verifying the conditions

residual independent 

normally distributed 

equal variance

Linear regression exists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The relationship between y and x is linear; that is, there is an equation, y=mx+c+ε that constitutes the population model.

Independent errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* The residuals are independent; the value of one error is not affected by the value of another error.
* In probability, two events A and B are independent if knowing that B happens does not alter the probability that A happens. E.g. , flipping two coins.
* A and B are independent if Pr[B]=0 or Pr[A|B] = Pr[A]
* But... how can we know that?

Normally distributed errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* For each value of x, the errors have a normal distribution about the regression line. This normal distribution is centred on the regression line.
* It may be written as ε~𝑁(0, σ2)

Equal error variance for all x values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* The errors about the regression line do not vary with x; that is, V[ε|x] = σ2 residual plot

#. Can we combine greenery and natural light to create a model for predicting wellbeing?
#. How does the combined model compare with individual models?
#. Can we put categorical variables into the model?

Question 1
""""""""""

With R2 values of 30-40%, both models leave a lot of variation unaccounted for. Could we do better, by using BOTH data series to explain the variation in the reported well-being?

**Covariance and Correlation:**\ http://ci.columbia.edu/ci/premba_test/c0331/s7/s7_5.html
**Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient:**\ https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/spearmans-rank-order-correlation-statistical-guide.php

*As an aside, while there are lots of Spearman's Rank information resources online, it is difficult to find one that does not make misleading claims about (surprise, surprise) normality assumptions. Many resources claim that you would use Spearman rather than Pearson correlation if you think your data series are not normally distributed.
This is false. Pearson correlation does not require normally distributed data (though some associated statistical tests do). The following two resources, for example, would also be good if it were not for such claims:*

**Linear Regression - Tutorials**
Here is an excellent course on regression. I would recommend that you use it as your main reference work for this subject. Lessons 1, 3 and 4 are most relevant to simple linear regression:
https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/1
`https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/3 <https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/1>`_
`https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/4 <https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/1>`_

The course also goes through multiple linear regression (Lessons 5-7) and discusses the use of categorical variables in detail (Lesson 8):
`https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/5 <https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/1>`_
`https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/6 <https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/1>`_
`https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/ <https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/1>`_\ 7

Here is a lesson on performing simple and multiple linear regression in Python. It is a lot more advanced than the Python we have covered, but may be of interest for those who are fairly confident with the language:
http://www.dataschool.io/linear-regression-in-python/

Stat Trek (http://stattrek.com/) is another good site for learning about concepts in statistics. Here is the start of their material on regression: http://stattrek.com/regression/linear-regression.aspx?Tutorial=Stat

[However, note that Stat Trek say "For any given value of X... the Y values [must be] roughly normally distributed", which is true (this is effectively equivalent to saying that the residuals must be normally
distributed), but they then imply that looking at a histogram of the data would help to confirm this, which is of course false. The histogram might show that the DATA looks normally distributed, but as we now know,  this is irrelevant! It's a residuals vs fits plot you need.]

Hypothesis Testing
------------------

**1.**  State your hypotheses.

**2.**  State your significance level: 𝛂

**3.**  What is the evidence (E)? (The Test Statistic)

**4.**  Calculate the probability of seeing evidence at least  as extreme as E, *if* H0 *is true*. (The “p-value”)

**5.** If the p-value is smaller than the significance, reject  H0 and accept H1. Otherwise there is not enough  evidence to reject H0.

* Purely Computational vs. Mostly Computational

  * Wider variety of output formats (e.g. Atlases, 3D/web).
  * Better support for 'finishing touches' (e.g. scalebars, north arrows, rule-based labels, etc.).
  * Better-quality output for less effort (e.g. Model Builder + QGIS styles).

  A Deceptively Simple Problem

..

      We want to show data on a map in a way that is **both accurate and informative**.



* Classification

  * The greater the accuracy of a **choropleth** or other class-based map, the less it’s possible generalise from it.
  * There is no 'right' way to group data into an arbitrary number of discrete classes (a.k.a. to generalise).

* Different ways of representation will be totally different

  * Judgement should based on distribution
  * Six Views of Employment

..

   ..

      Different colour and break schemes not only give us different **views** of the data, they give us different **understandings** of the data! Each potentially changes how the data looks and, consequently, how we perceive the distribution.



* Maps have a 'Rhetoric' `Do maps lie? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0_MBrJnRq0>`_ it always helps to look at a map with a critical  eye.

  Approaching EDA


  * From: `EDA—Don't ask how, ask what <https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/exploratory-data-analysis-eda-dont-ask-how-ask-what-2e29703fb24a>`_\ :
  * Descriptive Statistics: get a high-level understanding of your dataset
  * Missing values: come to terms with how bad your dataset is
  * Distributions and Outliers: and why countries that insist on using different units make our jobs so much harder
  * Correlations: and why sometimes even the most obvious patterns still require some investigating

    * Preview data
    * Check total number of entries and column types
    * Check any null values
    * Check duplicate entries
    * Plot distribution of numeric data (univariate and pairwise joint distribution)
    * Plot count distribution of categorical data
    * Analyse time series of numeric data by daily, monthly and yearly frequencies

* 
  Signal & Noise  


  * Starting at a chart 

    * The problem of relying on statistics alone was amply illustrated by Anscombe's Quartet (1973)...
    * We *are not* very good at looking at spreadsheets. 
    * We *are* very good at spotting patterns visually.
    * ^ Or, as Albert Einstein reportedly said: "If I can't picture it, I can't understand it."

  * What Makes a Good Plot?

    * Serves a **purpose** — it is clear how it advances the argument in a way that could not be done in the text *alone*.
    * Contains only what is **relevant** — zeroes in on what the reader *needs* and is not needlessly cluttered.
    * Uses precision that is **meaningful** — 
    * Far too many charts or tables could be easily written up in a single sentence.
    * Far too many charts or tables contain redundancy, clutter, and 'flair'.\
    * Don't report average height of your class to sub-millimeter level accuracy, or lat/long to sub-atomic scale.

  * The Purpose of a Chart

    * Think of a chart or table as part of your ‘argument’ – if you can’t tell me how a figure advances your argument (or if your explanation is more concise than the figure) then you probably don’t need it.
    * Identify & prioritise the relationships in the data.
    * Choose a chart type/chart symbology that gives emphasis to the most important relationships.

  * Beyond the Chart
  * Why a table is sometimes better than a chart:

    * You need to present data values with greater detail
    * You need to enable readers to draw comparisons between data values
    * You need to present the same data in multiple ways (\ *e.g.* raw number *and* percentage)
    * You want to show many dimensions for a small number of observations
    * 表格的格式  数字对齐方式 信息不重复 不遗漏
